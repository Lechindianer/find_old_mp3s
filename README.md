# FindOldMp3s

This project creates a CLI tool which will find MP3 files with bad bitrate. Bakeware will produce a standalone binary
file - this is NO escript release!

## Setup

```shell
mix deps.get
MIX_ENV=prod mix release
```

The built binary will be in `_build/prod/rel/bakeware/find_old_mp3s`
